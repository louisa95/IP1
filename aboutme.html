  <p>Hello World!
    I'm super excited to be publishing my very first website. Glad you're here. So let's jump right into it and get to the introductions. My name is Louisa Konchellah and I am a student at Moringa School,currently doing the Moringa Prep course.</p>

<p>I'm an Economics major in UoN and I'll be graduating this year!
My job experiences include a six week program with the University of Addis Ababa,where I was working with the undergraduate students to train them on the benefits of becoming an Entrepreneur. It also includes working with the Maasai Mara Marathon for three years, where I served as a volunteer. Through my work experience with different backgrounds and people, I have genuinely been termed as a 'people person'and that's absolutely true. </p>
<p>  So why Moringa? you may ask. I have always been a fun of taking apart and putting things back together from a young age and this 'need to explore' followed through into University where I felt like my Creative needs weren't being met. That's where Moringa comes in, it enables me to think outside the box, create new ideas and to fearlessly be myself in my creative growth.
My current interests and hobbies include;</p>

  <ul>
     <li>Dancing</li>
     <li>A Great cup of coffee</li>
     <li>Singing</li>
     <li>Watching Movies(MCU and GOT geek right here)</li>
     <li>Having Intellectual Conversations</li>
     <li>Definitely learning How to Code</li>
  </ul>
